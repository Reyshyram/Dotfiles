
# How to use

In order to install my dotfiles, you first need to update your system:

    sudo dnf upgrade --refresh

If you're using nobara, use `nobara-sync` instead.
After that, you can now clone the repository:

    git clone -b fedora https://github.com/Reyshyram/Dotfiles.git
Then, cd into the directory containing the dotfiles:

    cd Dotfiles
Finally, launch the install script:

    ./install.sh
If you're using Nobara, please also install Gnome Text Editor : `sudo dnf install gnome-text-editor`. The GTK theme will only work on system-wide flatpak installs.

The installation should now be completed. If there is any problem, feel free to open an issue.

## Compatibility
This script is only confirmed to be working under Nobara / Fedora 39 and Gnome 45, because it uses dnf in order to install the required packages.
